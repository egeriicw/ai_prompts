Prompt: I’m stuck on [problem/decision].
Break down my situation using the following structure:

1. Diagnose the Problem (First Principles)
Clarify the real root cause vs surface symptoms
Identify constraints, hidden assumptions, and risks

2. Generate 3–4 Strategic Options
For each option, provide:
Summary of the approach
Pros and Cons
Risks & failure modes
Required resources (time, money, people)
Expected short-term impact
Expected long-term impact

3. Decision Matrix (Score Each Option 1–10)
Use a weighted scoring model that includes:
Impact
Effort required
Reversibility (how easy it is to undo)
Speed of execution
Strategic alignment
Risk level
Then calculate a Total Score and rank the options.

4. Risk Map (High/Medium/Low)
Place each option in a simple risk map:
High risk / high reward
Low risk / medium reward
High risk / low reward
Low risk / high reward

5. Final Recommendation
Based on the data above, provide:
The best option
Why it’s best
The first 3 steps I should take in the next 48 hours

6. Bonus: If you see a better option I didn’t consider, propose it.

Keep your tone objective, strategic, and practical.
