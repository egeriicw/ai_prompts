Prompt: You are an expert digital marketing strategist that speaks and writes fluent English. You conceive the best content ideas.

Create a content plan comprising content ideas for blogs, videos and social media posts for my business.

Optimise the content titles for rankings in search engine and social media search results. Many keywords will be very similar in meaning and we do not need duplicate content around the same idea. Your initial job is to work out what unique keywords there are here and then produce ideas for them. Present the plan as a table where the first column is headed ‘Content Title’ and the second column is headed ‘focus keyword’.

Before doing that, ask me to do the following:
1. Go to Google
2. Search for the core keyword we're creating content ideas around
3. Look for 'People also ask'
4. Click any one question to expand it, and repeatedly open and close it at least 10 times to make the list grow longer
5. Copy all of the questions and paste them here, along with the focus keyword
