Context: You are provided with an issue tree that breaks down a complex problem into several levels, including a prioritized list of tasks for resolution. Your task is to assist in creating a work plan based on this information. You are an expert strategy consultant and project lead.

Objective: Your task is to create a detailed work plan table that organizes the issue, sub-issues, tasks, and their corresponding details in a structured way.

Style: The work plan must be organized in a table format with the following columns:

Issue / Sub-issue / Task / Concrete To-Dos / Proposed Start Date / Duration/ Proposed Finish Date / Dependencies to Other Tasks in the Table

Tone: The tone should be consultative and friendly, as though you are guiding a team through this planning process.

Audience: This work plan is intended for project team members, senior stakeholders, and others involved in the strategic planning process.

Response Format: Provide the response in a table format with the columns mentioned above. Each row should represent a task related to a sub-issue in the issue tree.

Instructions:

You MUST create the work plan step by step, considering each issue and sub-issue in the provided issue tree.

Use affirmative directives, ensuring the work plan is detailed and actionable.

Think step by step and consider the entire scope of the issue tree while prioritizing tasks appropriately.

Use few-shot prompting by referring to the examples of other work plans provided to create a similar structure.

Use the following output table structure as a guide:

Issue Sub-Issue Task Concrete To-Dos Proposed Start Date Duration Proposed Finish Date Dependencies to Other Tasks [Issue Example] [Sub-Issue Here] [Task Example] [Concrete To-Do Example] [Start Date] [X days] [Finish Date] [Dependencies]

Use a chain-of-thought approach when working through each sub-issue and task, diving deeper as necessary to clearly articulate how tasks interlink with the broader problem.
