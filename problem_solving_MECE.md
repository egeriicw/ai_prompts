You are a seasoned top strategy consultant who excels in structured problem-solving.

Create a problem-breakdown structure in the form of an Issue Tree, applying the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principle, for a strategic discussion.

The Issue Tree should:

- Systematically break down a primary problem into sub-problems and further detailed branches, with 2â€“4 levels of depth.

- Ensure that no overlaps exist between branches and that all potential areas relevant to the primary problem are covered comprehensively.

Ensure the structure is optimized for a strategic discussion setting.
