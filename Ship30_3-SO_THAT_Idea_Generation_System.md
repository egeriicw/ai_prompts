I am going to train you on an Idea Generation System called The 10 Magical Ways (To Expand Anything).

What this framework does is take a single topic or idea and then brainstorm 10 different ways to write about that idea—based on the following “10 Magical Ways.”

- Tips
- Stats
- Steps
- Lessons
- Benefits
- Reasons
- Mistakes
- Examples
- Questions
- Personal Stories

The idea here is that any idea can be expanded by using these 10 ways.

So let me give you an example.

Let’s say the topic I want to write about is “real estate.”

We can generate 10 high-quality ideas by combining the topic with these 10 Magical Ways.

So our list of ideas would look like this:

- Tips for getting your real estate license
- Stats about the real estate market in 2025
- Steps to buy your first rental property
- Lessons I learned buying my first rental property
- Benefits of getting into real estate at a young age
- Reasons I would encourage every college student to set a goal to buy their first rental property before graduation
- Mistakes most real estate professionals make that cause them to lose luxury market clients
- Examples of average people who became real estate millionaires
- Questions you should ask yourself before buying your first piece of real estate
- The story of how I almost lost my entire life’s savings buying the wrong rental property

So high-level, this is how the framework works.

However, there are some rules I’d like you to follow when executing this framework to generate the highest-quality ideas possible:

Rule #1: Always present the most specific version of the idea (for each of the 10 Magical Ways).

For example, “tips.”

- V1: Tips for real estate = very vague, bad
- V2: Tips for getting into real estate = better, but still vague
- V3: Tips for getting your real estate license = better
- V4: Tips for getting your real estate license in Chicago before you turn 30 = a lot better (because it’s more specific)
- V5: Tips for getting your real estate license in Chicago before you turn 30 (even if you’re working full time and on a budget) = the best because it’s the most specific

So always err on the side of specificity. Don’t present the “vague” version.

Rule #2: Combine each specific “10 Magical Ways” with critical, urgent, or expensive problems that specific type of reader would be most interested in.

For example:

- V1: Mistakes most real estate professionals make = very vague, bad, and no critical, urgent, or expensive problem
- V2: Mistakes most real estate professionals make that cause them to lose clients = slightly better, but still bad because it’s vague and no critical, urgent, or expensive problem
- V3: Mistakes most real estate professionals make that cause them to lose high-net worth luxury clients = better, less vague and now hints at an “expensive” problem (you wouldn’t want to lose these types of clients!)
- V4: Mistakes most real estate professionals make that lead to buyers backing out at the last minute = different, good, and now hints at both an “urgent” and an “expensive” problem (urgent because someone “just” backed out, and expensive because that means no money for the real estate professional)

Rule #3: When giving the reader something tangible, pick an arbitrary number to make it even more tangible.

For example, if the headline was something like, “Strategies to buy your first rental property below market value,” we can make this headline even more tangible and compelling by picking an arbitrary number of strategies we’re going to share with the reader.

“3 strategies to buy your first rental property below market value.”

And as some general rules of thumb:

- Odd numbers tend to be better than even numbers.
- Most ideas (written in headline format) are 10 or below (so you wouldn’t say, “100 strategies to buy your first rental property below market value.” Stick with 10 as the ceiling.)
- You want to avoid more than 1 actionable number per headline. So you wouldn’t say, “7 strategies to buy your first rental property below market value, and 3 mistakes to avoid in the process.” Those are 2 different ideas.
- But you CAN have 1 actionable number AND a dollar figure of some sort. For example, “7 strategies to buy your first $500,000 rental property below market value.” That’s OK.
- Don’t use the same number for every single headline. For each headline, pick a different number, so that we can generate a wide range of different types of ideas.

High-quality ideas happen at the intersection of:

- These 10 Magical Ways
- Each idea being its most “specific” version
- And each idea in some way talking about a critical, urgent, or expensive problem

The FOR WHO Framework

Once you have 10 ideas for a single topic (using the 10 Magical Ways framework above), I’d like you to combine it with the FOR WHO framework.

How this works…

There are typically 10 “audiences” that can work for any individual idea:

- Audience 1: The Beginner - someone who hasn’t started doing this “yet” but wants to, they just don’t know where to start. (Easy framework here is anytime someone is a First-Timer, or wants to do something for the first time.)
- Audience 2: The Intermediate - someone who has already been doing this thing, they just aren’t seeing the results they’ve been looking for (and don’t know what they’re doing wrong and/or what they need to do to fix it/generate the outcome they desire).
- Audience 3: The Proficient Expert - someone who has been doing this kind of thing for a while, and is fairly proficient, but is “stuck” somewhere and unsure of how to break fast the level they’ve plateaued at for a while. This usually requires them to change the way they think/break some sort of belief, invest in building a set of new, more valuable skills, or learn how to do something very specific that unlocks a new level of proficiency and/or working with a new level of customer/client.
- Audience 4: The No-Budget Person - someone who is trying to do something on an extreme budget, doesn’t have very much to invest, but wants to figure out a path forward that doesn’t involve spending a bunch of money.
- Audience 5: The High-End Option - someone who wants the “Ferrari” of solutions and is willing to invest heavily in acquiring new skills and breaking through to the next level. (This can be applied in lots of different ways. For example, if we were talking about fundraising for startups, this audience might be the startup trying to raise $100M vs a startup trying to raise $100k. $100M, in itself, is the high-end option.) Pro tip, “big” numbers are the secret here.
- Audience 6: The Specific Location - this is a specific type of person anchored to a physical or digital location. So it’s not just “for anyone,” it’s for a “specific type of person” and that person can be anchored to a physical location (Chicago, Italy, Europe, The US, a specific school, etc.) or a digital location (”On LinkedIn” or “On Discord” or “On Amazon” etc.)
- Audience 7: The Specific Demographic - a more specific type of person based on age, race, gender, socio-economic status, etc., relevant to the topic at hand. For example, if we’re talking about “how to start writing online,” some demographics might be “…as a college student” or “…as a retired widow” or “…as an army veteran,” or “…as a Millennial” etc. Demographics can be powerful ways to niche down to even more specific audiences.
- Audience 8: The Specific Outcome - the specific outcome someone desires from this topic. (For example, “Tips to buy your first rental property” can speak to all sorts of different audiences depending on the outcome that is being mentioned. Like “Tips to buy your first rental property and start building passive revenue in your 20s” is a different outcome and for a different type of audience than “Tips to buy your first rental property without risking any money you have saved for retirement.”
- Audience 9: The Sub-Industry - the topic tailored to a specific sub-industry or niche. For example, if the topic is “personal development,” the FOR WHO can become all the different industries that can be applied to, “personal development for SaaS startup founders” vs “personal development for executive coaches,” etc. But the FOR WHO can also be niches within an industry. So if the topic is “how to buy your first rental property,” a different niche might be, “how to buy your first commercial building” or “how to buy your first Airbnb” or “how to buy your first small hotel chain,” etc., since these are all niches within that industry and would create lots of different types of audiences.
- Audience 10: The Specific Product or Service - the topic tailored to a specific sub-industry or sub-audience by niching down on the specific product or service. For example, instead of just saying “marketing” you can speak to a more specific audience by saying “email marketing” or “email copywriting,” etc. The more specific you can be on the type of product or service related to the topic, you can tap into new audience segments.

The SO THAT Framework

Once you have 10 ideas for a single topic (using the 10 Magical Ways framework above), combined with the 10 Audience Archetypes above, I’d like you to combine these one more time with the SO THAT Framework

How this works…

There are typically 10 “Outcomes” that can work for any individual idea:

- Outcome 1: Make More - Readers want to make more money, and understand how this topic can help them increase their earning potential.
- Outcome 2: Save More - Readers want to save money, and understand how this topic can help them stop wasting money and/or save more money.
- Outcome 3: Stop Losing - Readers want to overcome existing, urgent, sometimes “expensive” pain. They want to STOP some sort of issue in their life, relationship, or business immediately.
- Outcome 4: Gain Status - Readers want to know their efforts will lead to sustained credibility, trust, status in their industry or marketplace or ecosystem or even amongst friends/family, and in some cases, even build their legacy.
- Outcome 5: Avoid Losing Status - Readers want to know they are taking the right actions and don’t have to worry about losing status in any way. They want to be assured they’re headed down the right path.
- Outcome 6: Get There Faster - Readers want to get whatever outcome they want, as fast as possible. (The bigger the outcome, the “faster” they want it.)
- Outcome 7: Get There Without Pain - Readers want to know you’re giving them the easy way, and it won’t cost them very much money, time, frustration, etc.
- Outcome 8: Get There Without Financial Cost - Readers want to know how they can achieve their goal without incurring a financial burden and/or how to do it in the most economical way possible.
- Outcome 9: Use Insider Information - Readers want to know they’re being given a “proven blueprint” of some kind, and are being shown a shortcut for them to get what they want faster and in some sort of “guaranteed” way (because it’s been done before).
- Outcome 10: Fulfillment - Readers want to unlock some sort of existential outcome as the result of their efforts. They want a new level of happiness, or fulfillment, or feeling of groundedness and presence, or to “know” they are on the right path, etc.

I am going to give you the topic, and then I’d like you to generate 10 ideas for me to write about by using this 10 Magical Ways framework.

But I’d like you to do this in steps: 

First, when you present these ideas back to me, I would like you present me a bulleted list of 10 ideas, each idea after each of the 10 Magical Ways as follows, written as a headline in upper-case style (each word in the headline capitalized):
