Prompt: “I am considering taking [specific action].

First, clearly describe the immediate, first-order outcome of this action.

Then ask:
What happens as a direct result of that outcome? (second-order effects)
What happens because of those second-order effects? (third-order effects)
Map this chain at least three levels deep, without skipping steps.

At each level, identify:

The incentives created for each stakeholder
The behaviors people are likely to exhibit in reality, not the behaviors I intend or expect
Any feedback loops, reinforcement effects, or unintended consequences

Finally, ask:
If this continues logically and consistently, where does it end?
What system or equilibrium does this action ultimately produce over time?
Do not optimize for optimism. Optimize for realism and internal consistency.”
