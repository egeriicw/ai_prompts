# What is the TCREI Framework?
The TCREI framework is a structured approach to crafting effective AI prompts. It ensures that the AI understands your request by breaking it down into five essential components:
* Task: Define what you want AI to do, including specifying a persona and desired output format.
* Context: Provide relevant details that help AI generate more accurate and meaningful responses.
* References: Give examples or benchmarks to guide AI’s response style and structure.
* Evaluate: Review AI’s output to determine if it meets your needs.
* Iterate: Refine and tweak your prompt to improve results.
