Go to Google Opal, sign in with your Google account (free during beta), and click "+ Create New" to access the visual canvas with a prompt bar

Prompt: "Create a content idea generator. Input a topic and platform (LinkedIn or Twitter). Pull recent trends, then generate 5-10 post ideas with attention-grabbing hooks, 3-bullet outlines, and relevant hashtags. Output as a formatted table with thumbnail image suggestions"

Refine your app by chatting with Opal to add features like "Add export to Google Docs for easy copying," then test with a real topic like "Give me ideas for a post on best AI tools," and select your platform

Fine-tune outputs by selecting nodes and clicking "Suggest an edit to the prompt" to refine tone or specificity, then click "Share App" in the top right and set permissions to "Anyone with the link"
