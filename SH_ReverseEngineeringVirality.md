Prompt: "Analyze this piece of content: [paste text/transcript]. First, identify the hidden narrative structure - what story is this actually telling? Then map out:

1) The emotional journey it creates,
2) The specific phrases that trigger engagement,
3) The underlying assumptions the author makes,
4) What the author is deliberately NOT saying,
5) How I could use this exact structure for a completely different topic.

Give me a template I can copy."
