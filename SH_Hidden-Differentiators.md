Prompt: Analyze my career history, roles, and experiences below:
[paste career history]

Ask me additional questions about my career history. Identify 3–5 hidden differentiators that set me apart from other candidates with similar titles or backgrounds. Look beyond obvious skills and focus on patterns, uncommon experiences, trade-offs I’ve made, or moments where I took responsibility, solved ambiguous problems, or created outsized impact.

For each differentiator:
Explain why it’s uncommon
Tie it to a specific story or moment I can reference in interviews
Suggest how to frame it so it sounds confident and credible, not boastful
Prioritize insights that would help me stand out in interviews, answer “Tell me about yourself” more memorably, and differentiate me from equally qualified candidates.
