Read each issue from the issue tree and consider the entire conversation we have had so far.

For each issue estimate the benefit of following this option with a number of 1 (low benefit) to 10 (highest benefit).

The benefit is measured by the optionâ€™s contribution to to the defined success factors in the TOSCA framework.

The effort is measured by the time and cost of pursuing this option.

Create the final output in a table with following columns: Top level issue, sub-issue, sub-sub issue, benefit (number between 1 and 10), arguments why you chose this number, effort (number between 1 and 10), arguments why you chose this number for effort, Ratio of benefit to Effort calculated by dividing the number of the benefit by the number of the effort.

Follow this process from issue to issue:

## Read the issue.

## Consider the benefit. Attribute a number for the benefit.

## Consider the effort. Attribute a number for the effort.

Until you have done this for all issues.

Then, create a table in the format described above as final output.
