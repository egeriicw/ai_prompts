I am going to train you on an Idea Generation System called The 10 Magical Ways (To Expand Anything).

What this framework does is take a single topic or idea and then brainstorm 10 different ways to write about that idea—based on the following “10 Magical Ways.”

- Tips
- Stats
- Steps
- Lessons
- Benefits
- Reasons
- Mistakes
- Examples
- Questions
- Personal Stories

The idea here is that any idea can be expanded by using these 10 ways.

So let me give you an example.

Let’s say the topic I want to write about is “real estate.”

We can generate 10 high-quality ideas by combining the topic with these 10 Magical Ways.

So our list of ideas would look like this:

- Tips for getting your real estate license
- Stats about the real estate market in 2025
- Steps to buy your first rental property
- Lessons I learned buying my first rental property
- Benefits of getting into real estate at a young age
- Reasons I would encourage every college student to set a goal to buy their first rental property before graduation
- Mistakes most real estate professionals make that cause them to lose luxury market clients
- Examples of average people who became real estate millionaires
- Questions you should ask yourself before buying your first piece of real estate
- The story of how I almost lost my entire life’s savings buying the wrong rental property

So high-level, this is how the framework works.

However, there are some rules I’d like you to follow when executing this framework to generate the highest-quality ideas possible:

Rule #1: Always present the most specific version of the idea (for each of the 10 Magical Ways).

For example, “tips.”

- V1: Tips for real estate = very vague, bad
- V2: Tips for getting into real estate = better, but still vague
- V3: Tips for getting your real estate license = better
- V4: Tips for getting your real estate license in Chicago before you turn 30 = a lot better (because it’s more specific)
- V5: Tips for getting your real estate license in Chicago before you turn 30 (even if you’re working full time and on a budget) = the best because it’s the most specific

So always err on the side of specificity. Don’t present the “vague” version.

Rule #2: Combine each specific “10 Magical Ways” with critical, urgent, or expensive problems that specific type of reader would be most interested in.

For example:

- V1: Mistakes most real estate professionals make = very vague, bad, and no critical, urgent, or expensive problem
- V2: Mistakes most real estate professionals make that cause them to lose clients = slightly better, but still bad because it’s vague and no critical, urgent, or expensive problem
- V3: Mistakes most real estate professionals make that cause them to lose high-net worth luxury clients = better, less vague and now hints at an “expensive” problem (you wouldn’t want to lose these types of clients!)
- V4: Mistakes most real estate professionals make that lead to buyers backing out at the last minute = different, good, and now hints at both an “urgent” and an “expensive” problem (urgent because someone “just” backed out, and expensive because that means no money for the real estate professional)

Rule #3: When giving the reader something tangible, pick an arbitrary number to make it even more tangible.

For example, if the headline was something like, “Strategies to buy your first rental property below market value,” we can make this headline even more tangible and compelling by picking an arbitrary number of strategies we’re going to share with the reader.

“3 strategies to buy your first rental property below market value.”

And as some general rules of thumb:

- Odd numbers tend to be better than even numbers.
- Most ideas (written in headline format) are 10 or below (so you wouldn’t say, “100 strategies to buy your first rental property below market value.” Stick with 10 as the ceiling.)
- You want to avoid more than 1 actionable number per headline. So you wouldn’t say, “7 strategies to buy your first rental property below market value, and 3 mistakes to avoid in the process.” Those are 2 different ideas.
- But you CAN have 1 actionable number AND a dollar figure of some sort. For example, “7 strategies to buy your first $500,000 rental property below market value.” That’s OK.
- Don’t use the same number for every single headline. For each headline, pick a different number, so that we can generate a wide range of different types of ideas.

High-quality ideas happen at the intersection of:

- These 10 Magical Ways
- Each idea being its most “specific” version
- And each idea in some way talking about a critical, urgent, or expensive problem

I am going to give you the topic, and then I’d like you to generate 10 ideas for me to write about by using this 10 Magical Ways framework.

And when you present these ideas back to me, I would like you present me a bulleted list of 10 ideas, each idea after each of the 10 Magical Ways as follows, written as a headline in upper-case style (each word in the headline capitalized):

- Tips: <Headline>
- Stats: <Headline>
- Steps: <Headline>
- Lessons: <Headline>
- Benefits: <Headline>
- Reasons: <Headline>
- Mistakes: <Headline>
- Examples: <Headline>
- Questions: <Headline>
- Personal Stories: <Headline>

Are you ready for the topic?
