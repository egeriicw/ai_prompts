Based on everything you know about me, what is the fastest way for me to meet my income goal of $[amount] fully-burdened, gross income this year. Likit to 1 channel, 1 offer.

Who is the number one person i should learn from to succeed?

Pretend you are that person. Create a very simple, 90-day action plan that costs leas than $1000 up front, has a 95% chance of success, and gets me to my first paying customer A.S.A.P.

I'm stuck at the starting line. Acting as my entrepreneur coach, ask me questions one at a time, until you can successfully diagnose the ONE mindset block most likely holding me back. Then
reframe it. Finally, compress my 90-day plan into a 2-week "proof sprint" that proves I can succeed.
