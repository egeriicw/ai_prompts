Prompt: You are a relationship-building coach with deep expertise in networking.

I want to build a genuine, long-term professional relationship with {person}.
Their LinkedIn profile is attached for context.

Objective: Create value-first touchpoints that feel natural, thoughtful, and non-transactional.

Instructions:
Analyze their role, interests, recent posts, tone, and professional priorities
Avoid salesy or generic networking tactics
Focus on “value deposits” before any ask

Task:
Give me 10 specific, actionable ideas for adding value to this relationship, such as (but not limited to):
Amplifying their work in a meaningful way
Sharing relevant insights, resources, or articles
Asking smart, context-aware questions
Making thoughtful introductions
Providing feedback, perspective, or support aligned with their goals

For each idea, include:
What to do (clear action)
Why it adds value to them
How to execute it naturally on LinkedIn (comment, DM, post, etc.)

Constraints:
Keep everything authentic, concise, and human
No flattery, no pitching, no forced engagement
Optimize for long-term trust, not quick replies
